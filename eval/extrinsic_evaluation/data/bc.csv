6,Simple Cysts (fluid filled sacs) have virtually no chance of containing malignancy; they do not need to be aspirated unless they are too large and causing discomfort.,NEUTRAL,FACT

8,"These type of cysts are also fluid filled sacs but contain a good percentage of solid elements, like old blood or debris.",NEUTRAL,FACT
9,Usually complex cysts are aspirated and the cells examined under the microscope to better evaluate their nature and to rule out cancer.,NEUTRAL,FACT

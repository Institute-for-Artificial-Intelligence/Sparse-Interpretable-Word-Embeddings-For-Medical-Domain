42,Cats are obligate carnivores after all.,NEUTRAL,FACT
43,"There is likely a psychological connection, but it seems that there must be a physical connection, too, since the cat does this somewhat if something is really rich, like muffins, which I haven't had in forever since I haven't figured out how to make gluten free.",NEUTRAL,OPINION

104,Eating certain food for someone allergic to metal causes illness (not just skin rashes to jewelry).,NEUTRAL,FACT
105,It's very important when suspecting an allergy to medications to look at the INACTIVE ingredients in pills.,NEUTRAL,FACT
106,"For instance I have a list of meds I'm allergic to and the docs just put ""allergic to aspirin, wellbutrin, etc..."" when in reality the one common element in all I'm allergic to is certain types of metal in the coating.",NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE
107,"You're doctor will not help figure out your REAL allergy because almost no one is actually allergic to the active ingredients in pills, but doctors only list the pill your allergic to and don't ask what it is about those pills you are allergic to.",NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE
108,"You can test allergic to foods that contain metals (brocolli, chocoate, whole wheat, etc...) and again, it may be that you're allergic to those food because of a metal or additive added....so if a person is allergic to multiple foods it's important to rule out the possibility of a common element in all of them.",NEUTRAL,OPINION

110,"I went in to food allergists many years ago that literally wouldn't test me for allergies because they didn't think I had enough ""evidence"" that I was allergic.",NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE
111,"For those of us with chronic fatigue and ""vague"" symptoms like stomach aches, migraines, etc....",NEUTRAL,EXPERIENCE
112,it's very unlikely that a doctor would order a whole battery of testing to rule out the many many illnesses that could cause these things.,NEGATIVE,OPINION
113,"So....please....if you are a person that has skin reactions when you wear certain jewelry, or have chronic acne and rash on face from makeup (which contains high amounts of metal), or react when eating food high in metal content (nuts, many veggies, coffe....) then please do yourself a favor and order the Melissa test yourself!",NEUTRAL,OPINION
114,A doctor will literally look at you like you're nuts or a hypocondriac if you tell him/her that you think you're allergic to metal.,NEGATIVE,OPINION
115,(I told all my doctors when they ask at the beginning of appointments when I'm allergic to that I'm allergic to metal and they literally don't put it in my records...,NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE

118,"So ... even though it's a harsh reality, it seems that especially those with chronic, multiple ailments have to be their own advocate and in my case (and I'm assuming for others) take matters into our own hands after being told by docts that there's nothing wrong and ""it may be just normal for you to be tired""....Sorry for the crazy long post!",NEUTRAL,OPINION

143,you could be a great help to those you know who are getting reactions to jewelry...,POSITIVE,OPINION

145,most commonly people are allergic to nickel...which represents 10% of the population who are allergic.,NEGATIVE,FACT
146,A large number of people allergic to metals are allergic to multiple types of metal....so a reaction to just cheap jewelry probably indicates a nickel allergy.,NEUTRAL,OPINION
147,it is important to note that almost all things made of metal are alloys...meaning it is a mix of metal.,NEUTRAL,FACT
148,"For instance, I had a copper IUD that caused me to have 13 cysts within 2 months of insertion....turns out there was nickel in it also..",NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE
149,The important thing to note is that many people don't respond with significant health problems until they get metal inserted in the body....such as cavity filings...contrast given for MRI's....so it is so important to be aware of the allergy and know to ask what includes metal or not...,NEUTRAL,FACT
150,"however, the impact a person may feel when having a metal allergy and being exposed through jewelry, deoderant, make up, toothpaste, candy.....is unknown.",NEUTRAL,FACT
151,Before I had a back implant I was sluggish and sick often...turns out it was undiagnosed allergy to metal.,NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE

153,For some reason I thought that I should make sure...turns out there is a very high metal content!,NEGATIVE,OPINION
154,"The doctor and even tech administering the contrast had no idea, but the main active ingredient in metal and many contrast solution in nickel based or copper based, given that the nickel content in a piece of chocolate cake can send my heart rate up to 130, I hate to think of what could have happened had I taken the doctor's word that there was no metal in the contrast!",NEGATIVE,FACT

158,She can't wear the white gold because of the alloys.,NEGATIVE,EXPERIENCE
159,I don't understand why doctors assume that a skin allergy to metals isn't serious enough to consider that taking the stuff internally would still be bad.,NEGATIVE,OPINION
160,"I mean, the whole reason the skin scratch tests work as tests is because the skin is reacting to something the whole body is allergic to.",NEUTRAL,FACT
